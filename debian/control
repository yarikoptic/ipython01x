Description: enhanced interactive Python shell
 IPython can be used as a replacement for the standard Python shell,
 or it can be used as a complete working environment for scientific
 computing (like Matlab or Mathematica) when paired with the standard
 Python scientific and numerical tools. It supports dynamic object
 introspections, numbered input/output prompts, a macro system,
 session logging, session restoring, complete system shell access,
 verbose and colored traceback reports, auto-parentheses, auto-quoting,
 and is embeddable in other Python programs.
 .
 This is a non-official, custom build of IPython post 0.11 with
 workbooks support.  It provides IPython01X module thus not
 conflicting with system-wide installed IPython
